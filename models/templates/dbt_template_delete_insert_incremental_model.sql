{#
    key notes on delete+insert model:
    - file_format defaults to delta (TODO: confirm this is dune hive metastore setting)
        - when providing file_format config to model, dbt fails on unable to support 'format' property
    - incremental_predicates filter the DELETE operation on the target table for better performance
        - this limits the rows scanned during the delete phase to match the source filter window
